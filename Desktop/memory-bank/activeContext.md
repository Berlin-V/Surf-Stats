## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **SQLite for Message Persistence**

    - Decision: Use SQLite for message storage instead of in-memory storage
    - Rationale: Provides persistence across restarts without adding external dependencies
    - Trade-offs: Potential performance impact, but improved reliability

2. **WebSocket for Communication**

    - Decision: Use WebSockets for real-time communication between instances
    - Rationale: Provides persistent connections with low overhead
    - Trade-offs: Requires connection management, but enables real-time messaging

3. **Path-Based Message Routing**
    - Decision: Track message paths to prevent loops in the network
    - Rationale: Ensures messages don't circulate indefinitely
    - Trade-offs: Adds overhead to messages, but prevents infinite loops

### Implementation Decisions

1. **Message Acknowledgment**

    - Decision: Implement explicit message acknowledgment
    - Rationale: Ensures reliable message delivery
    - Trade-offs: Increases message count, but improves reliability

2. **Controlled Message Republishing**

    - Decision: Implement a controlled republishing strategy for unacknowledged messages
    - Rationale: Ensures message delivery without overwhelming the system
    - Trade-offs: Increases complexity, but improves reliability

3. **Runtime Configuration**
    - Decision: Support runtime configuration of logging
    - Rationale: Enables troubleshooting without restarts
    - Trade-offs: Adds complexity, but improves operability
