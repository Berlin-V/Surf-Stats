## In-Progress Features

### Message Deduplication

- **Type Definition**

    - Added `clusterGroupId` optional property to `TMessage` type definition
    - Enables identification of messages from the same cluster group
    - Supports backward compatibility with existing messages
    - Compilation tests passed successfully

- **Message Initialization**

    - Updated `initializeMessage` function to include `clusterGroupId` from connection
    - Ensures all outgoing messages have the cluster group identifier
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

- **Database Schema**

    - Added `CLUSTER_GROUP_ID` column to the message table
    - Updated message persistence to store the cluster group identifier
    - Extracts `clusterGroupId` from message JSON for storage
    - Ensures cluster information is preserved across restarts

- **ACK Message Handling**

    - Updated `sendAcknowledgement` function to copy `clusterGroupId` from original message
    - Ensures ACK messages have the same cluster identifier as the original message
    - Prevents duplicate ACK processing in multi-instance deployments

- **Client Library**
    - Created `slipstream-client` library for receiver-side deduplication
    - Implemented `SlipstreamDeduplicator` class for message deduplication
    - Added support for in-memory, Redis, and SQLite storage backends
    - Provided comprehensive documentation and examples
    - All tests passing
