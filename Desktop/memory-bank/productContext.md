# Product Context: Slipstream

## Business Purpose

Slipstream serves as the communication backbone of the Surfboard Payments system, enabling real-time data synchronization across multiple cloud environments. It addresses the critical need for a distributed payment processing system that maintains data consistency while operating across different geographic regions and cloud providers.

## Problem Statement

In a distributed payment processing system, several challenges arise:

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that payment data remains consistent across all environments is critical for financial integrity.

2. **Cross-Environment Communication**: Traditional systems struggle to maintain reliable communication between instances deployed across different cloud providers.

3. **Message Reliability**: Payment messages must be delivered reliably, with guarantees that they won't be lost or duplicated.

4. **Targeted Communication**: Different types of messages need to be routed to specific environments based on their purpose and relevance.

5. **Operational Visibility**: Monitoring the health and performance of a distributed system requires specialized tools and approaches.

## Solution

Slipstream addresses these challenges through:

1. **WebSocket-Based Communication**

    - Establishes persistent connections between server instances
    - Provides real-time message delivery with minimal latency
    - Supports secure communication with SSL/TLS options

2. **Message Routing System**

    - Path-based routing prevents message loops in the network
    - Tag-based routing enables targeted message delivery
    - Message acknowledgment ensures delivery confirmation

3. **Persistence Layer**

    - SQLite database stores messages for reliability
    - Tracks message delivery status and acknowledgments
    - Implements controlled republishing for unacknowledged messages

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
    - Prometheus metrics for system monitoring
    - Structured logging for troubleshooting
    - Health check endpoints for system status

## User Personas

### System Operators

- **DevOps Engineers**: Need to monitor system health and performance
- **System Administrators**: Need to configure and maintain the Slipstream instances
- **Support Engineers**: Need to troubleshoot issues when they arise

### Developers

- **Backend Developers**: Need to understand how to use Slipstream for data synchronization
- **Integration Engineers**: Need to configure message routing for specific use cases
- **System Architects**: Need to design systems that leverage Slipstream's capabilities

## User Experience Goals

### For System Operators

- **Visibility**: Clear metrics and logs to understand system behavior
- **Configurability**: Easy configuration of connection parameters and retry settings
- **Reliability**: Minimal maintenance requirements with automatic recovery from failures

### For Developers

- **Simplicity**: Straightforward message patterns for common operations
- **Flexibility**: Support for custom message types and routing strategies
- **Predictability**: Consistent behavior in various operational scenarios

## Key Features

1. **Connection Management**

    - Automatic connection establishment and maintenance
    - Configurable reconnection attempts and intervals
    - Heartbeat monitoring to detect connection issues

2. **Message Routing**

    - Path-based routing to prevent message loops
    - Tag-based routing for targeted message delivery
    - Support for various message types (SK, SA, ACK, etc.)

3. **Message Persistence**

    - Storage of messages in SQLite database
    - Tracking of message delivery status
    - Controlled republishing of unacknowledged messages

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
    - Prometheus metrics for system monitoring
    - Structured logging with configurable verbosity
    - Health check endpoints for system status

## Integration Points

Slipstream integrates with:

1. **Payment Isolate (PI)**: Provides communication between PI instances across environments
2. **Ocean Server**: Enables data synchronization for the Ocean ORM
3. **Monitoring Systems**: Exposes metrics for Prometheus and other monitoring tools
4. **Logging Systems**: Produces structured logs for centralized logging solutions

## Success Metrics

The success of Slipstream is measured by:

1. **Message Delivery Rate**: Percentage of messages successfully delivered
2. **Message Latency**: Time taken for messages to be delivered across environments
3. **System Uptime**: Availability of the Slipstream service
4. **Error Rate**: Frequency of message delivery failures
5. **Connection Stability**: Frequency of connection drops and reconnections

## Future Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Message Types**

    - Support for additional message patterns (GW, SW, CMD)
    - Improved message prioritization and queueing

2. **Advanced Routing**

    - More sophisticated tag-based routing options
    - Support for message transformation during routing

3. **Performance Optimizations**

    - Reduced message overhead
    - Improved handling of high-volume message scenarios

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
    - More detailed metrics for system performance
    - Advanced alerting capabilities
